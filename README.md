# CPP MODULES

## Summary

This repository contains the modules of the C++ piscine from 42 School.

Each module is in a folder named `cppXX` where `XX` is the number of the module.

The higher the number, the more advanced the module is.

In all of these exercises, I have adhered to good coding practices, ensuring that my code is clean, readable, and efficient. All my code has been compiled using the `c++` compiler with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and it has been confirmed to compile with the `-std=c++98` flag as well.

## Module 02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overloading, and Canonical Form

This training module introduced key aspects of the C++ language including ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the canonical form. Exercises were provided to enhance understanding and proficiency in these areas:

- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism:** Ad-hoc polymorphism was covered through function overloading, which allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This allows the same function name to be used for different types.
- **Operator Overloading:** Operator overloading was also explored, providing a way to redefine C++ built-in operators. This allows those operators to work with user-defined classes, improving code readability and efficiency.
- **Canonical Form:** The module also discussed the canonical form in C++. This includes a default constructor, a copy constructor, an assignment operator, and a virtual destructor, which are crucial in managing memory and ensuring proper functionality of user-defined types.
